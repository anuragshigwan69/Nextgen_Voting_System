## 📖 About the Project

**NextGen Voting System** is a full-featured, secure online voting platform designed specifically for **college elections**. It enables students to register, verify their identity via OTP, and cast votes for candidates running for specific posts — all within a controlled and transparent environment.

The system is divided into two main sides:

- 🎓 **Student Side** — Register, verify via OTP, login, and cast votes securely.
- 🛠️ **Admin Side** — Manage students, candidates, classes, and control the entire election lifecycle.

> The goal is to eliminate manual ballot-based voting and replace it with a **tamper-proof, OTP-secured digital election system** that ensures every vote is authentic and traceable.

## 🗄️ Database Setup

> ⚠️ **Database schema coming soon.** The SQL dump file will be added to this repository shortly.

Once the file is available, import it using:

```bash
mysql -u root -p < database/votingd.sql
```

Or create the database manually:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE votingdb;
USE votingdb;
-- Tables will be listed here once the schema file is added
```

After setting up the database, update the DB credentials inside the JSP files wherever you see a connection string like this:

```java
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/nextgen_voting_system", "root", "your_password"
);
```

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your machine:

- Java JDK 17
- Apache Tomcat 11
- MySQL 8+
- Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers

> ⚠️ This project does **not** use Maven or Gradle. It is a plain **Dynamic Web Project** managed entirely through Eclipse IDE.

---

### 🚀 Steps

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Nextgen_Voting_System.git
```

**2. Open Eclipse and import the project**

- Go to `File` → `Import` → `Existing Projects into Workspace`
- Click `Browse` and select the cloned project folder
- Click `Finish`

**3. Add JARs to the Build Path**

All required JARs are already inside `WEB-INF/lib/`. To confirm Eclipse recognises them:

- Right-click the project → `Build Path` → `Configure Build Path`
- Go to the `Libraries` tab
- Click `Add JARs` → navigate to `WEB-INF/lib/` → select all JARs
- Click `Apply and Close`

**4. Configure the Database**

- Create your MySQL database (see [Database Setup](#-database-setup))
- Open the relevant JSP files and update the DB connection credentials:

```java
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/nextgen_voting_system", "root", "your_password"
);
```

**5. Configure Email / OTP Settings**

- Open `sendOtp.jsp`, `sendOtpRegister.jsp`, and `sendForgotOtp.jsp`
- Update the Gmail credentials:

```java
props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com");
props.put("mail.smtp.port", "587");
props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
props.put("mail.smtp.starttls.enable", "true");

String senderEmail    = "your-email@gmail.com";
String senderPassword = "your-app-password";
```

> 💡 Use a **Gmail App Password**, not your regular Gmail password.
> Generate one here → [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

**6. Add Tomcat Server in Eclipse**

- Go to `Window` → `Preferences` → `Server` → `Runtime Environments`
- Click `Add` → select `Apache Tomcat v11.0`
- Browse to your Tomcat installation directory → click `Finish`

**7. Deploy and Run**

- Right-click the project → `Run As` → `Run on Server`
- Select your Tomcat 11 server
- Click `Finish`
- Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080/Nextgen_Voting_System/
```
